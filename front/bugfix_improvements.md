# Bugfix :warning: #

1. Contact nav icon redirect to contact section in home page 

## Solved :ok_hand: ##

&xrArr; Fixed at once on 22/11/2024. Removed ScrollTrigger in small views for better use and created functions to enable and disable the plug-in, witch was generating view issues and scroll problems.  

~~1. Home mobile view~~
    
   ~~1. Horizontal scroll~~ 
    
   ~~2. Click instruction overlay~~
    
   ~~3. Header size~~
    
   ~~> Maybe will be fixed at once~~
